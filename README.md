This is a git-versioned subset and slightly modified version of TI's [CC3200SDK](http://www.ti.com/tool/cc3200sdk).

This repository's purpose is to provide CC3200SDK as a submodule for the [Contiki Operating System](https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/).

New versions will only appear in this repository only if and when Contiki's CC32xx port needs to use them.

Modifications (for current and upcoming versions):

* Only files used by Contiki are included here. Documentation and files related to IAR and CCS have been removed.

All sources are and will remain otherwise intact.

If you need CC3200SDK for any other purpose, do not clone this repository. A full version of the software can be downloaded by following the above link. A history of previous versions can be found in [TI's relevant wiki page](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC31xx_%26_CC32xx).

Do not open pulls / issues on this repository, unless they are immediately related to using CC3200SDK with Contiki.
